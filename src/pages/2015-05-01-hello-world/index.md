Don't do it, they said. They all said that. They thought it was a silly idea - something I would regret rather quickly.

I was adamant, I was doing. I'm a free person, in a free country. I can do what I want within legal limits - and it was legal.

John had just shown me his kick-ass tattoo of the outline of a triangle and that had got me thinking - apart from the time I said all tattoos are terrible - there is no reason I don't have a tattoo. From this realisation I spent literally hours researching what image or illustration should be printed in my skin forever.

I made a mind map of things I like from The XX to carbonara. Crossing off the sassy tweets and Obama/Biden memes, I knew I had a great shortlist.

I thought finding a parlour with a even cost:"ability to serialise needles correctly" ratio was going to be difficult but thanks to a new app a friend of mine is developing, Phattoo, it was easy.

People bleat on about how tattoo are *so* difficult but they don't know the power of Google Images, mind mapping techniques and having friends with beta invite codes to their own apps.

It was only a few days to my birthday, so I regarded it as a birthday treat.

A decently tolerated 30 minutes later, with only one break in the middle, to review the parlour on Phattoo as excellent and then as requested rate the Phattoo 5 stars in the App Store, I was done. From thought to having my arm in clingfilm in 4 hours.

This all happened about a week ago. I'm now 24, and I'm still #noregrats but obviously spelt correctly.
